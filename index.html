        <h2>Walter Perez H.</h2>
        <p>Hello! Thanks for visiting my site! Welcome! I have been coding and designing web sites for a while, I would like to have the oportunity to work with a
            big company.
            <br> I want to keep improving and learn new skills but inside of a professional enviroment, sharing knowleges, working
            styles and coding tricks.
            <br> Until now I have been teaching myself in my free time, waiting for the day when I would work for a company following
            my passion, coding.

                <p>I made this website for my father's barbershop, It was the first and most serius project I ever did untill that time, I wanted to put all the knowleges I had in that moment in this website, and also help to my father with his buisness, What I used was HTML5, CSS, and a bit of Javascript which I was learning in that time. As I was going to keep mainteining his site I decided to use those tecnologies. </p>

            <div class="photo-information">
            <p>In this website, I had to work for my friend who has a hairdresser salon, He wanted to update the web by himself but he didnt know how to use those tecnologies, so what I did was Installing a wordpress, and leaving it good configurated for him, I also teached him how to use it, so he can later keep his website updated with his photos and news.</p>

                <p>I did this website when I was learning css, I used to practictes in the way to my job, in the underground, so basically this was all coded with my mobile phone, I didnt have internet, so it maded it more "funny" and serius, I wanted to use almost everything that I knew in that time, using only the knowlege that I already had.</p>
